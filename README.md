# Basic-Image-Segmetation

Image Segmetation using the Expected-Maximization Algorithm. Tha basic goal here is the classification of the data of the image
in order to "split" the image to categories of various colors. Another thing about this algorithm is the restructure of the image
into an image with lesser colors, if needed, avoiding large and expensive in terms of memory images.
